# Sharp80

TRS80 Emulator for Windows

This is a full-featured emulator of a TRS-80 Model III circa 1981. It includes:

* Model III computer running at standard 2.03MHz (can be run faster)
* Full Z-80 emulation including all undocumented opcodes
* Emulation of a floppy disk controller supporting 4 virtual floppy drives
* Support for all major virtual floppy formats (DMK, JV3, JV1)
* Windowed and full-screen (Alt-Enter) modes
* Support for all video modes, including wide characters and Kanji mode

To use this code, you'll need:

* The latest MS Visual Studio 2017 (the free community
edition works fine)
* The SharpDX library (download the 3.1.0 SDK from sharpdx.org) and then put the dll files into the
/SharpDX directory under the Sharp80.exe file.
